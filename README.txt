After opening the .bat file, if the modules are not installed, it will handle the installation.
Then you can start using the .bat file again. The .bat file will create a folder named games to download the RAR file there.
After that, it will extract the archive and may require administrative permissions for installation and setup.
If the Games folder does not exist, create it yourself.
